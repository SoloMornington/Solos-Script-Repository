// This script gives all the inventory contained in the object
// to whoever touches it. The items will be in a folder with the same
// name as the giver object.
// It is the big brother to the Give First Notecard script in the
// very_basic folder of this repository.

// UPDATE: v.2.0 has some basic usability improvements. It imposes a few
// rules for the benefit of anyone who has to maintain a giver kiosk:
// * If you add a script to the object inventory, it will warn you
//   that this is a bad idea.
// * All inventory items will be checked for copy/trans permissions.
//
// The giver script will still give objects even if these checks don't
// pass. Changing the object inventory will cause the checks to be
// performed again.


// This string is the text of the hover text. 
string gHoverText = "Touch for some goodies!";
